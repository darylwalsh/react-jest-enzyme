###Brittle 

Test behavior, not implemention. 

###No Shapshots

  1. *No TDD
  2. Brittle (any change to component will break)
  3. Too easy to ignore failures and update
  4. No test intent
    -If there's a failure, does code still meet spec?
  5. If used, it's alongside traditional tests
    -You decide what's right for you
